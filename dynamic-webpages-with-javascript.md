# Dynamic webpages with JavaScript

## What is JavaScript?

* JavaScript(JS) is a lightweight, interpreted or just-in-time compiled programming language. While JavaScript is most well-known as the scripting language for web development,     many non-browser environments also use it. Some examples are Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat.

* It's also important not to confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language. Bot Java and JavaScript are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other 
  countries. The two programming languages have very different syntax, semantics, and use.
  
## Variables in JavaScript

### What is a variable?

* Variables are containers for storing data(values)

* There are 3 ways to declare a JavaScript variable:
  * Using ```var``` - example: ```var animal```
  * Using ```let``` - example: ```let name```
  * Using ```const``` - example: ```const time```

* For this example, we'll use a, b, c as variables to store data.
  * ```var a = 5;```
  * ```var b = 6;```
  * ```var c = a + b;``` (here we added the value of a and b and the sum will be stored in variable c)
