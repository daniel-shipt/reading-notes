#### Growth Mindset
## A growth mindset to me is someone has the **drive** and **willingness** to continually better themselves everyday, whether that be personal or within their career. It's important to understand what comes with this kind of mindset though. I speak for myself when I say that it's **very** difficult to adapt this mentality and it takes a lot of work and sacrifice, but it can be the most rewarding thing you can do for yourself and your future, if you are willing to do so.
