## Growth Mindset
#### A growth mindset to me is someone has the drive and willingness to continually better themselves everyday, whether that be personal or within their career. It's important to understand what comes with this kind of mindset though. ***I speak for myself when I say that it's very difficult to adapt this mentality and it takes a lot of work and sacrifice***, but it can be the most rewarding thing you can do for yourself and your future, if you are willing to do so.

## 3 Reminders to keep myself in a Growth Mindset

1. Always be looking for the next thing.
      - Whether it be a career goal, or just a personal goal.
2. Always be learing something new.
      - A skill, trade, improving upon something you've already learned.
3. Constantly focus on how you can improve yourself.
      - Health and Wellness, adapt good habits, find like minded individuals to share and grow with.
