### Understanding the terminal and using basic commands

1. mkdir - Allows you to create your local directory. For example, if you wanted to create a local directory for reading-notes, it would be mkdir reading-notes.
2. pwd - This command shows your local current working directory.
    * For example:
        *Daniel$ pwd
         /mnt/c/Users/Daniel
