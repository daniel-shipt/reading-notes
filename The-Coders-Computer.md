### Understanding the terminal and using basic commands

1. mkdir - Allows you to create your local directory. For example, if you wanted to create a local directory for reading-notes, it would be mkdir reading-notes.
2. pwd - This command shows your local current working directory.
    * For example:
            * input: **Daniel$ pwd** output: **/mnt/c/Users/Daniel**
3. cd - Allows you to open up a certain directory, we will use reading-notes as an example. You can type **cd reading-notes** in and you can start working out of that directory.               Afterwards, you can use **pwd** to verify that you are in the correct directory.

## Cloning your REPO from GitHub

1. It's a good idea to verify your information before you start the process, you can do that by using these commands in the terminal.
      * git config --global user.name
      * git config --global user.email
            * **These will return your user name and email verifing your information**
2. Next step is to use the git clone command to clone your repository to your local directory.
      * That can be done by doing **git clone** *insert https link here*
