### Understanding the terminal and using basic commands

1. mkdir - Allows you to create your local directory. For example, if you wanted to create a local directory for reading-notes, it would be mkdir reading-notes.
2. pwd - This command shows your local current working directory.
    * For example:
            * input: **Daniel$ pwd** output: **/mnt/c/Users/Daniel**
3. cd - Allows you to open up a certain directory, we will use reading-notes as an example. You can type **cd reading-notes** in you can start working out of that directory.               Afterwards, you can use **pwd** to verify that you are in the correct directory.
