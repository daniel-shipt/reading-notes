## What is Markdown?
#### Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You can control the way the document looks; formatting words in **Bold** or *Italics*, adding images or even lists!

1. **List item 1**
2. *list item 2*
3. ***List item 3***

# You can also do different headers and sizes, this being the largest with H1!

## This is an H2 tag

### This is an H3 tag

#### This is an H4 tag

##### This is an H5 tag

###### And all the way down to the H6 tag, which is the smallest!
