## What is Markdown?
#### Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You can control the way the document looks; formatting words in **Bold** or *Italics*, adding images or even lists!

1. **List item 1**
2. *list item 2*
3. ***List item 3***

# We can also do different headers and sizes

## The more hastags you use

### The smaller your words will get

###### All the way down to <h6> which is the smallest text!
